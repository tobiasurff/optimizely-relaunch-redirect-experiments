# Optimizely Redirect Experiment Framework

The visual editor in Optimizely allows users to create simple redirect experiments with ease, this framework is meant to extend these capabilities by building a robust framework that allows for mapping tables between existing and target urls. This is particularly useful for A/B tests of relaunched versions of a website that might not follow the same url structure.
